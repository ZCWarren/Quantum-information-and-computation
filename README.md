NUS PC5228 final project record.

## Introduction

Welcome to the README for the PC5228 Final Project. This project encompasses two pivotal components in the field of quantum computing:

- Quantum Computer Test of Local Realism
- Two-Qubit Teleportation

The aim of this project is to delve into the complexities of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, demonstrating fundamental quantum principles through practical experiments and simulations.

## Quantum Computer Test of Local Realism

This part of the project focuses on testing the principle of local realism in the realm of quantum mechanics using a quantum computer. The concept of local realism, which involves the properties of physical systems existing independently of measurement, is a cornerstone in the study of quantum mechanics. Our approach involves designing and implementing experiments on a quantum computer to investigate the validity and implications of this principle in quantum systems.

## Two-Qubit Teleportation

The second component of the project deals with the phenomenon of quantum teleportation. Specifically, we explore the teleportation of a quantum state between two qubits. This process is a striking demonstration of quantum entanglement and non-locality. Our work includes the development of a quantum circuit capable of achieving two-qubit teleportation, which is then tested and analyzed for efficiency and fidelity.

## Project Structure

- `Bell_CHSH/`: Contains scripts, and code related to the Quantum Computer Test of Local Realism.
- `Two_Qubit_Teleportation/`: Includes all relevant files and scripts for the Two-Qubit Teleportation experiment.
- `README.md`: This introductory file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

Clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure that you have installed the necessary quantum computing libraries and tools, such as Qiskit. For beginners (like myself), we strongly recommend getting involved with quantum circuits using IBM's Composer (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer). To install Qiskit, use the following command in your terminal:

`pip install qiskit`

To run the experiments, follow the instructions in the respective files. Detailed usage and parameters can be found in the individual README files within each experiment folder.
